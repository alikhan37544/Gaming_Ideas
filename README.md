## üéÆ How to Play

### Controls
- **Left Arrow**: Move paddle left
- **Right Arrow**: Move paddle right
- **P**: Pause/Unpause the game
- **R**: Restart the game (only when game over)
- **Space**: Continue to next round (after round summary)

### Basic Gameplay
1. You control the paddle at the bottom of the screen
2. The AI controls the paddle at the top
3. Break bricks by hitting them with the ball
4. Prevent balls from going past your paddle
5. Collect power-ups to gain advantages
6. Complete rounds by destroying bricks or outscoring the AI
7. Game continues until a player loses (loses 5 or more balls)

## üîÑ Game Mechanics

### Ball Physics
- Balls bounce off paddles, walls, and bricks
- Ball angle changes based on where it hits the paddle
- Ball speed gradually increases throughout the game
- Every 30 seconds, each ball in play spawns a duplicate (up to max 6 balls)
- Balls remember which player last hit them (for scoring purposes)

### Paddles
- Player paddle: Controlled by arrow keys
- AI paddle: Automatically tracks and tries to hit balls
- Paddle size can be increased with power-ups
- Paddle speed: 20 pixels per frame

### Ball Loss
- When a ball goes past your paddle, you lose it
- Losing balls incurs a score penalty
- If you lose 5 balls in a round, you lose the game
- When all balls are lost, the round ends

## üìä Scoring System

### Brick Points
| Brick Type | Description | Points |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Type 1 (Blue) | Basic brick | 1 point |
| Type 2 (Red) | Tough brick | 3 points |
| Type 3 (Gray) | Unbreakable brick | 5 points |
| Type 4 (Gold) | Boss brick | 10 points |
| Type 5 (Teal) | Moving brick | 3 points |

### Ball Loss Penalties
- Each lost ball incurs a penalty that decreases with each subsequent loss:
  - 1st ball lost: -5 points
  - 2nd ball lost: -4 points
  - 3rd ball lost: -3 points
  - 4th ball lost: -2 points
  - 5th ball lost: -1 point
- Maximum penalty per round: 15 points

### Round Score Calculation
```
Round Score = (Points from broken bricks) - (Ball loss penalty)
```
- If calculated score is negative, it's set to 0

### Total Score
- Total score is the sum of all round scores
- The player with the higher total score at game end is the overall winner

## üåà Power-ups

Power-ups randomly spawn when breaking bricks (25% chance). The power-up direction determines which player can collect it.

| Power-up | Color | Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Speed | Yellow | Increases all balls' velocity by 10% |
| Size | Green | Increases collector's paddle width by 20% (max 200%) |
| Multi | Purple | Adds a new ball near an existing one |
| Score | Orange | Adds 20 points to collector's score |
| Laser | Light Blue | Shoots a laser beam that destroys bricks in its path |
| Slow | Teal | Decreases all balls' velocity by 30% |

- Power-ups moving downward can be collected by the player
- Power-ups moving upward can be collected by the AI
- A notification appears when a power-up is collected

- 85% chance for each brick position to contain a brick
- Higher levels have more tough and unbreakable bricks

### 2. Checkerboard Pattern (Level % 5 == 1)
- Alternating brick placement
- Outer edge bricks are always breakable
- Inner bricks may sometimes be unbreakable (10% chance)

### 3. Fortress Pattern (Level % 5 == 2)

- Strategic breakable "entrance points" on each side
- 60% chance for interior bricks to appear

### 4. Triangle Pattern (Level % 5 == 3)
- Bricks arranged in a triangular formation
- Mix of brick types with increasing difficulty

### 5. Circular Pattern (Level % 5 == 4)

- Ignores other balls until the target is out of range

### Movement Logic

- Uses same paddle speed as player (20 pixels per frame)
- No "look ahead" prediction - reacts to current ball position

- Can collect power-ups moving upward
- Gets the same benefits as the player would
- Competes for advantageous power-ups

## üí° Tips and Strategies

1. **Ball Angle Control**: The ball's bounce angle depends on where it hits your paddle. Hit with the edge for sharper angles.

2. **Power-up Prioritization**: The "Multi" and "Size" power-ups are particularly valuable - position your paddle to collect these when possible.

3. **Strategic Brick Breaking**: 
   - Focus on creating paths to higher-value bricks
   - Target moving and boss bricks for higher points
   - Use the laser power-up to cut through unbreakable bricks

4. **Ball Management**: With multiple balls in play, prioritize saving the ball closest to your paddle.

5. **AI Weaknesses**: The AI struggles with:
   - Very fast balls
   - Multiple balls spread across the screen
   - Extreme bounce angles

6. **Level Advancement**: Use the 30-second countdown period to maximize your score before the level resets.

7. **Penalty Minimization**: Try to minimize ball losses as the penalties can significantly impact your score.

8. **Score Optimization**: Break as many high-value bricks as possible while maintaining ball control.
